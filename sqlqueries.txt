1. teaching by teacher per year like in Excel

select t.code as Code, t.name as Name, sum(ifnull(i.p1, 0) + ifnull(i.p2, 0)+ ifnull(i.p3, 0) + ifnull(i.p4, 0)+ ifnull(i.p5, 0)) as Hours 
	from teacher as t, teacher_course_implementation as i
	where t.id = i.teacherid
	group by t.name;

2. teaching by student group like in Excel

select c.name as Courses, g.code as `Group`
	from curriculum as cu, `group` as g, course as c 
	where c.curriculumid = cu.id 
	and g.curriculumid = cu.id
	order by g.code, c.name;

3. Student groups by degree program

select g.code as `Group`, g.degree as Degree
	from `group` as g 
	order by g.degree, g.code;

4. Teachers by degree program

select distinct t.code as Code, t.name as Name, g.degree as Degree
	from `group` as g, teacher as t, course_implementation as ci, group_course_implementation as gci, teacher_course_implementation as tci
	where g.id = gci.groupid
	and t.id = tci.teacherid
	and ci.id = tci.course_impleid
	and ci.id = gci.course_implementationid
	order by t.code, g.degree;

5. Teaching by teacher per week (weeks)

select distinct t.code as Code, t.name as Name, sum(ifnull(tci.p1, 0)) as P1, sum(ifnull(tci.p2, 0)) as P2, sum(ifnull(tci.p3, 0)) as P3, sum(ifnull(tci.p4, 0)) as P4, sum(ifnull(tci.p5, 0)) as P5
	from teacher as t, course_implementation as ci, teacher_course_implementation as tci
	where t.id = tci.teacherid
	and ci.id = tci.course_impleid
	group by t.code
	order by t.code
